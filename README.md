# RDB-Desktop
The ResearchDB (Java Desktop version) is a sophisticated note taking app which requires the user to document subjects of interest in a simplified research form. The app allows the user to create a database pertaining to a paritcular subject and begin to enter notes about the subject. Each note entry requires the user to document their source and details in which the note addresses about the subject the database pertains too. For example, if the user was reserching about the Holy Bible, they could create a database called holy-bible.db. The user then would add notes about the Holy Bible. The user may have a video lecture about manuscript copies from a leading scholar; so the user would enter at minimum details required for a note the video addresses:
